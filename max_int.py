#Design an algorithm that generates the first n numbers in the following sequence:; 
#1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, _, _, _, â€¦

num_int = int(input("Input a number: "))    # Do not change this line
num_int = i
while(i<-1):
    print("Please enter a number", i ,"when finished, enter a negative number")
# Fill in the missing code
print("The maximum is", max_int)    # Do not change this line
